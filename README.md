#People-In-Panic

## Introduction
My father is daignosed with a muscle disease [ALS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis)  what for now is that he cannot raise his arms or hands corretly to use the phone when he want to reach my mother in the case he needs her. In the search for a device that my father can use when my mother is away to a neighbor or getting groceries there are only home-security alarms with a subscription or with a device what is locker to the house. In the case that my father is over by my place he also need to call me or my mother in case of need/panic. 

I discovered a small "key-finder" device [iTag](https://github.com/s4ysolutions/itag) that has a button and can be used with his mobile phone (Android 10). So there are only purchase cost of â‚¬ 1.89 and his mobilephone with a telephone subscription.
